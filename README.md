## Overview

This **R package** implements functions to conduct simulation studies
for methodological comparisons in the context of predictive model
evaluation studies.

**NOTE: This package is no longer maintained!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

This package can be installed from GitHub with the following command

    remotes::install_github("maxwestphal/SEPM.SIM")

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Details

Several simulation studies and real data examples are described at
<https://maxwestphal.github.io/SEPM.PUB/>.

The main goal of this package is to ensure that these numerical
experiments can be reproduced.
