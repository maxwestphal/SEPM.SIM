## Overview

This R package implements functions to conduct simulation studies for methodological comparisons in the context of predictive model evaluation studies. 

**NOTE: This package is no longer maintained!**

---

## Installation

This package can be installed from GitHub with the following command

```{r install, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/maxwestphal/SEPM.SIM")
```
